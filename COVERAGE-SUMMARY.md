## Reaching 80% Coverage

To achieve 80% coverage, you need to add approximately **30 more test scenarios** across 7 new test files.

### Recommended Priority Order:

#### Phase 1: Fix Existing Issues (1-2 days)
- Fix `standings.spec.ts` timeout issue
- Ensure all 11 existing tests pass consistently

#### Phase 2: Critical Path Coverage (1 week)
**Target: 60% coverage**

Create these test files:
1. `tests/homepage.spec.ts` - Countdown & announcements (3 tests)
2. `tests/prizes.spec.ts` - Prize calculations (5 tests)
3. Expand `tests/standings.spec.ts` - Add 6 more tests

#### Phase 3: High Priority Features (1 week)
**Target: 75% coverage**

4. `tests/data-loading.spec.ts` - API & error handling (7 tests)
5. `tests/rules.spec.ts` - Scoring system (4 tests)

#### Phase 4: Complete Coverage (1 week)
**Target: 80%+ coverage**

6. `tests/hall-of-fame.spec.ts` - History & leaders (6 tests)
7. `tests/mobile.spec.ts` - Responsive behavior (4 tests)

## Key Insights

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Solid Foundation** - All pages render correctly
2. **Navigation Works** - 100% coverage on core navigation
3. **Infrastructure Ready** - Playwright configured and working
4. **Good Test Structure** - Clear, maintainable test organization

### ⚠️ Gaps
1. **No Feature Testing** - Only testing page loads, not functionality
2. **No Data Testing** - Google Sheets integration untested
3. **No Error Scenarios** - No fallback/error state coverage
4. **No User Interactions** - Dropdowns, search, clicks mostly untested

### 🎯 Opportunities
1. **High ROI Tests** - Prize calculations are critical and easy to test
2. **Data Mocking** - Mock Google Sheets for faster, reliable tests
3. **Visual Regression** - Add screenshot comparison for UI consistency
4. **Accessibility** - Use @axe-core/playwright for a11y testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Review Coverage Analysis** - See `FEATURE-COVERAGE-ANALYSIS.md`
2. 🔄 **Fix Failing Tests** - Address timeout in `standings.spec.ts`
3. 📝 **Prioritize Features** - Decide which gaps to address first

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
4. 🚀 **Implement Homepage Tests** - Countdown & announcements
5. 🚀 **Implement Prizes Tests** - Prize calculations
6. 🚀 **Expand Standings Tests** - Search, day selector, data display

### Medium Term (3-4 weeks)
7. 🚀 **Data Integration Tests** - API calls, errors, fallbacks
8. 🚀 **Rules & Hall of Fame Tests** - Content verification
9. 📊 **Coverage Dashboard** - Automated reporting in CI/CD

---

## Questions to Consider

1. **Test Data Strategy**
   - Should we mock Google Sheets data for tests?
   - Do we need separate test data fixtures?

2. **Coverage Goals**
   - Is 80% the right target, or should we aim higher?
   - Which features are most critical for your users?

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Should tests run on every commit?
   - Should failing tests block deployments?

4. **Maintenance**
   - Who will maintain and update tests?
   - How often should we review coverage metrics?
